# AmazonDEOrders
Export your orders from your Amazon DE account

The german Amazon site doesn't offer an export of all your yearly orders. Every year I need this for my taxes.
As it is still tax time, what better use of my time is there to automate this process (instead of doing my taxes)

Inspiration from

There is a similar project for Chrome

Maybe it is possible to combine them

Some issues I have with the other solutions. They
* Track order, for tax reasons I need the items
* Orders with more than 4 different items are incompletly described
